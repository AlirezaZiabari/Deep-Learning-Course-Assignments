#Deep Learning Course Assignments

These are my solutions to the assignments of Deep Learning Course Spring 2019 by Professor Mahdieh Soleymani. Most of my assignments were done with Google Colab.

In this course, I learned the foundations of Deep Learning, understood how to build neural networks with Pytorch and Tensorflow, and learned how to lead successful machine learning projects. I learned about GANs, Depp RL, CNNs, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more.
